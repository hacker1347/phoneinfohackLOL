# phoneinfohackLOL
# explanation
# The user is prompted to enter a phone number.

 # The script calls the entered phone number as a parameter to the API.

 # An HTTP request is sent to the API to retrieve information about the phone number.

# The API responds with the data, which is in JSON format.

# The script checks the API's response and checks whether the fetch was successful.

# If the response is successful, the information will be displayed in the terminal, including the phone number, area code, city and provider.

# If the response is not successful, an error message is displayed.
# Note: To make this script fully functional, you will need to include your own API URL and credentials. Please follow the API provider's instructions to obtain this information.

# I also make a tool without an API
# good luck
